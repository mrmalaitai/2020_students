Functionality simply looks at whether the product functions as intended and to ensure there are no problems, bugs, crashes etc.
The game works fine and is easy to play. There are no bugs so far but can be easily updated if found.

Intellectual Property is when the works belong to the creator and who has the right to use it. 
I drew the player, enemy, objects to ensure there was no copyright problems.

The End user is the user who will be using the product. The product should cater to the specific needs of that user.
People who might like this game are gamers who have a good sense of direction for controls. I made sure it was easy to use by only allowing 4 keys so not only gamers but any one could play.
